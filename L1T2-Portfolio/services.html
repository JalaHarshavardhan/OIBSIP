                        <p>We begin this list with one of the most exciting projects that you would be able to make. 
                            This is a great idea for CSE final year projects. You would need the dataset of crimes, 
                            and using the K-means algorithm, and you are required to predict the crime rate. 
                            This project has overarching importance in our society because we see an upward trend 
                            in the number of crimes committed daily.

                        <p>For all the machine and deep learning enthusiasts out there, this one should fit right into your alley. 
                            The premise of the project is straightforward. You have to create a classifier that should be able to 
                            find tumors just from the pictures of the brain that you would provide the model.

                        <p>Android devices are infamous for the amount of battery that they consume. 
                            Because Android is open-source, there are a lot of different devices out there. 
                            Optimizing apps for such a vast ecosystem is still a massive challenge for any app developer. 
                            Due to this poor optimization of apps, they tend to consume more battery.

                        <p>Yes, in this project, you will be creating a messaging app like WhatsApp, only that it will be using Bluetooth 
                            instead of the internet. On paper, you would be forgiven to think that this app serves no purpose whatsoever. 
                            But, if you are able to create a fully functional app that runs on Bluetooth and gives the ability to have a 
                            chat with another person.

                        <h2>6. Fingerprint voting system</h2>
                        <p>These major projects for cse have the potential to touch a lot of lives. Since all the fingerprints in this world 
                            are unique, this project leverages that exact fact. The specifics on how you implement the project lie in your hand, 
                            but you can try out different things like automatically casting a vote when the machine recognizes the finger print, 
                            Only unlocking the voting interface when the machine reads your fingerprint correctly, etc.
